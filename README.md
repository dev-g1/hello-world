# A little about myself
My name is Golden Iroka.
An aspiring budding developer.
I'm currently learning Web. Development using
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## My Journey into Web. Dev.
I formally began my journey in Web. Dev. about two weeks
ago. I'm currently enrolled in a program-
Side Hustle internship.
The program has really helped me to overcome
my early fears and concerns towards Web. Dev.

Prior to this time, I had read and researched a lot about
 Web. Dev. Programming and Software Dev. in general. And I must say that, I got really scared.

However,I would like to say that- two weeks into Web. Dev. ,
I am really excited.

Although, it has not been easy.
I've had some difficult times-codes
refusing to run as supposed...etc.

But then, I feel really excited.

Looking forward to much more, I'll be able to do- (coding and developing stuff)
Oh Lord help me üôè
In Jesus name, Amen.
Thank you very much.
